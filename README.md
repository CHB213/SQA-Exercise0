# Intro To Rust And It's OOP Characteristics

For my lightning talk paper I will be giving a brief introduction to Rust and it's syntax from its Primitive DataTypes to its built in Data Structures such as Vectors, Arrays, and HashMaps. Throughout the introduction I will include similar declarations and definitions from C and Java to help compare and contrast the key features that Rust offers.

After reading this paper, it is my goal that you will attained the following:

###### - A basic understanding of the functionality of Rust and the power it provides through its safety and concurrency
###### - A better understanding of what makes object oriented languages object oriented
###### - A new found enjoyment for what I like to call barebones programming

## Let's Start With, What Is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that is designed for performance, safety, and concurrency. It is a strongly-typed language, meaning that every value and expression in Rust has a specific data type that the compiler checks at compile-time to ensure that the program is correct.

In Rust, variables must be declared before they can be used. This means specifying both the name of the variable and its data type. For example, to declare an unsigned 16-bit integer variable in Rust, you would write:

```Rust
let my_unsigned_int: u16 = 42;
```
